Oli Cash, has gained a reputation for hi-tech, dancefloor-destroying music that makes people throw their hands in the air and go crazy. Think high-energy, aggressive funk, big basslines, crazy edits, intricate production and you’ll know the sound. \r\n\r\nSince his first release, back in 2005, things have gone ever upward. Winning “Best Single” at the Breakspoll Awards in 2007 was a huge boost early on and later that year the huge FTL anthem “Play It Loud”, which saw a move from breakbeat into big, dirty electro-house grooves, received a massive response and remains a firm crowd-pleaser to this day. Subsequent chart-smashers including “Bring Back Boogie” and “Megaloud”, and remixes for the likes of Lily Allen and The Crystal Method confirmed Far Too Loud's place among the big guns of electro-house. \r\n\r\n2012 saw Far Too Loud grow even more, with numerous Beatport top ten chart positions, remixes for artists such as Excision and Cyberpunkers and the release of his multi-genre Firestorm EP, which shook up the whole bass music scene.  2013 looks to be even bigger, as the “Faster Than Light” EP drops on June 3rd, featuring four brand new tracks bursting with his explosive trademark production and energy.\r\n\r\nHaving toured the world over, Oli is well experienced in delivering unique sets packed with high energy, whether it’s 200 people in a sweaty underground club or 20,000 at an outdoor festival, you can be sure it’s going to go off!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBookings\r\nAustralia\r\nstuart.balfour@ministryofsound.com.au\r\nBrazil/Mexico\r\nleandro@lve.art.br\r\nNorth America\r\nkevin@circletalentagency.com\r\nRest of World\r\ncontact@electrobooking.com\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nnick@nsdmt.com","city":"Brighton","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":"fartooloud","website":"http://fartooloud.com","website_title":"","online":true,"track_count":49,"playlist_count":6,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":425,"followers_count":75573,"followings_count":594,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":47695603,"kind":"user","permalink":"yallrick","username":"Yallrick","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/47695603","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/yallrick","avatar_url":"https://a1.sndcdn.com/images/default_avatar_large.png?d53bf9f","country":"France","full_name":"","description":"","city":"Bordeaux","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":null,"website_title":null,"online":true,"track_count":0,"playlist_count":1,"plan":"Free","public_favorites_count":164,"followers_count":18,"followings_count":130,"subscriptions":[]},{"id":13182481,"kind":"user","permalink":"simon-georges-ulrich","username":"Simon Georges Ulrich","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/13182481","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/simon-georges-ulrich","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000038213521-g4y6yf-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"France","full_name":"Simon Georges Ulrich","description":null,"city":"Bordeaux","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":null,"website_title":null,"online":true,"track_count":0,"playlist_count":0,"plan":"Free","public_favorites_count":125,"followers_count":14,"followings_count":58,"subscriptions":[]},{"id":5042148,"kind":"user","permalink":"knifepartyinc","username":"Knife Party","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/5042148","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/knifepartyinc","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000041350413-pcf6e2-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"Britain (UK)","full_name":"Knife Party","description":"Seizure Music.","city":"London","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://www.knifeparty.com","website_title":"","online":true,"track_count":21,"playlist_count":3,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":1,"followers_count":417387,"followings_count":0,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"pro-plus","name":"Pro Plus"}}]},{"id":3721694,"kind":"user","permalink":"edbangerrecords","username":"edbangerrecords","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/3721694","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/edbangerrecords","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000007659220-b0bljv-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"France","full_name":"Ed Banger Records","description":"MR FLASH / JUSTICE / KRAZY BALDHEAD / DSL / SEBASTIAN / DJ MEHDI / BUSY P / SO ME / UFFIE / FEADZ / MR OIZO / MICKEY MOONLIGHT / BREAKBOT \r\n\r\n","city":"Paris","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://www.edbangerrecords.com","website_title":"","online":true,"track_count":114,"playlist_count":4,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":22,"followers_count":167938,"followings_count":4,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":105165,"kind":"user","permalink":"bondax","username":"Bondax","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/105165","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/bondax","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000053573302-a58p8d-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"Britain (UK)","full_name":"","description":"2 teenage producers/djs\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\n'Giving It All' OUT NOW on iTunes - http://smarturl.it/GivingItAlliT?IQid=soundcloud\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nManagement:\u0026#13;\n\u003Ca href=\"mailto:danielbearman@me.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Edanielbearman@me.com\u003C/a\u003E\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nBookings:\u0026#13;\nWorld excl.

The german DJ, producer and label owner is an absolute star in analog and digital realms. He not only impresses with sounds, but also with numbers. The first time DJing with 17, the first own parties with 20, the big breakthrough shortly after. He has reached several million plays with his most successful tracks since then and melted away minds in countless clubs, at small and big festivals and a vast number of headphones of the mobile generation. The music of Robin gets under the skin, grabs the soul at the root and leaves one floating through the air on a cloud.\u0026#13;\n\"You are what you produce!\" is the motto, which he deploys since summer 2013, not only on his own productions, but also for the releases on his label Lausbuben Records, which he successfully runs with Daniel Bruns and Christopher Noble. The lightheartedness of the two previously released EPs will also develop the label into a million-Click Wonder - just like Robin himself.\u0026#13;\nIt initially all started small. It is not for nothing that his first own parties in Osnabrück clubs bore the name Electroschnipsel (German for Electro snippets). But organizing parties on a permanent basis was not, what Robin wanted. It was rather the feeling of having his own steady hand on the tiller and conning the crowd, what he wanted to experience. And that’s all he does today. With beautiful melodies and catchy vocals, his music plants a pleasantly warm feeling deep in the heart. It is the colorful world of confetti, glitter and bubbles and the incarnation of a carefree day, he embodies. A recipe for success, that has meanwhile brought him to half of Europe as a DJ \u0026amp; Live Act and repeatedly across the globe on the Internet.\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nRobin Schulz (DEUTSCH)\u0026#13;\nAus dem Leben eines Lausbuben\u0026#13;\nDie Geschichte von Robin Schulz ist eine Erfolgsgeschichte. Der Osnabrücker DJ, Produzent und Labelbesitzer ist in analogen und digitalen Gefilden ein absoluter Star. Er beeindruckt dabei nicht nur mit Tönen, sondern auch mit Zahlen. Das erste Mal Auflegen mit 17, die ersten eigenen Partys mit 20, der große Durchbruch kurze Zeit darauf. Seitdem hat er mit seinen erfolgreichsten Tracks mehrere Millionen Plays erreicht und in unzähligen Clubs, auf kleinen und großen Festivals und den vielen Kopfhörern der mobilen Generation die Gemüter zum Schmelzen gebracht. Denn die Musik von Robin geht unter die Haut, packt die Seele bei der Wurzel und lässt einen auf Wolken durch die Luft schweben.\u0026#13;\n\"Du bist, was Du produzierst!\" ist der Leitspruch, den er seit dem Sommer 2013 nicht nur auf seine eigenen Produktionen anwendet, sondern auch auf die Releases auf seinem Label Lausbuben Records, das er erfolgreich mit Daniel Bruns und Christopher Noble betreibt. Die Unbeschwertheit der beiden bisher erschienenen EPs wird auch das Label zu einem Million-Click-Wonder entwickeln – genauso wie Robin selbst.\u0026#13;\nDabei fing anfangs alles klein an. Seine ersten eigenen Partys in Osnabrücker Clubs trugen nicht umsonst den Namen Electroschnipsel. Doch Partys zu organisieren war auf Dauer nicht das, was Robin wollte. Vielmehr war es das Gefühl, selber das Ruder in der Hand zu halten und die Menge zu lenken, das er erleben wollte. Und nichts anderes tut er heute. Mit wundervollen Melodien und eingängigen Vocals pflanzt seine Musik ein wohlig-warmes Gefühl tief in die Herzen. Es ist die kunterbunte Welt von Konfetti, Glitzer und Seifenblasen und die Inkarnation des sorglosen Tages, die er damit verkörpert. Ein Erfolgsrezept, das ihn mittlerweile als DJ \u0026amp; Live Act nach halb Europa gebracht hat und im Internet längst in die ganze Welt.","city":"Osnabrück","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://newsletter.mfm-booking.de/2012_12_11_Robin_Schulz/","website_title":"Booking","online":false,"track_count":44,"playlist_count":5,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":258,"followers_count":83925,"followings_count":355,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":19906175,"kind":"user","permalink":"arno-brak","username":"Arno Brak","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/19906175","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/arno-brak","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000064863540-pulgfj-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"France","full_name":"Arno Brak","description":"Contact : Arno-Brak@gmail.com\r\n\r\nDeep - Tech - Tribal DJ/Producer from Paris, France\r\n\r\nLabels :\r\n\r\nBedroom House Records\r\nLocked Records\r\nArch 44\r\nHitfinders Music Brazil","city":"Paris","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":null,"website_title":null,"online":false,"track_count":14,"playlist_count":0,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":1606,"followers_count":1165,"followings_count":623,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":22556605,"kind":"user","permalink":"tomodell","username":"Tom Odell","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/22556605","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/tomodell","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000037189958-q5a6r5-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"Britain (UK)","full_name":"Tom Odell","description":"Debut album Long Way Down: http://smarturl.it/LongWayDownDigiDLX?IQid=sc\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nManagement: \r\nsam@urokmanagement.com\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nBooking: \r\nalex@codaagency.com\r\n\r\n---------------------------","city":"London","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://tomodell.com","website_title":"tomodell.com","online":false,"track_count":9,"playlist_count":2,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":0,"followers_count":109650,"followings_count":4,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":8780193,"kind":"user","permalink":"florian-paetzold","username":"Florian Paetzold","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/8780193","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/florian-paetzold","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000036290444-i4n43v-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"Germany","full_name":"","description":"Booking only for Germany:\r\nsteffen@dusteddecks.de\r\n\r\nBooking rest of the World\r\nkris@cokeandsmoke.com\r\n\r\nRemix Requests and Other:\r\np.c.i@hotmail.de\r\n\r\n\r\nNext Dates 2014:\r\n\r\n10.01 Rotterdam\r\n25.01 Altes Ziehwerk Delitzsch\r\n01.02 JCL Winter Sounds Ilmenau\r\n07.06 Sputnik Spring Break Pouch\r\n19.07 Weigendorf\r\n26.07 Loveweek Festival (Croatia)\r\n03.08 Loveweek Festival (Croatia)\r\n20.09 Kulturarena Kaltensundheim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npast Dates 2013:\r\n\r\n13.04 Underground Club Hannover\r\n26.04 Stadtclub Freiberg\r\n30.04 Altes Ziehwerk Delitzsch\r\n03.05 Acki Osterwieck\r\n09.05 XXXX Stötterling\r\n14.06 Silerschwein|Reineke Fuchs Köln\r\n06.07 Sunset Beach | Schladitzer Bucht\r\n31.07 Love Ship Novalja (Croatia)\r\n04.08 Holi Festival Harz / Elend\r\n10.08 St Barth Summer Session (Caribic)\r\n16.08 St Barth Summer Session (Caribic)\r\n17.08 Summer Rave Open Air | Osterwieck\r\n14.09 Blocked\r\n20.09 Acki Osterwieck\r\n21.09 Club Auslage Wien\r\n01.10 Blocked\r\n08.10 Blocked\r\n01.11 Radio 808 Zagreb (Croatia)\r\n01.11 Rooftop Party Skylight Zagreb (Croatia)\r\n15.11 Pathos München\r\n16.11 Ziehwerk Delitzsch\r\n22.11 1 Year Florian Paetzold Schützenhalle Rimbeck\r\n20.12 Acki Osterwieck\r\n28.12 Blocked\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\n\"It is in the nature of Music to give joy\"\r\n\r\nFlorian Paetzold is a true joy machine, with his emotional and groove-laden, melodically-dreamy songs, which get under your skin and incite you to dance.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1986 in the small town of Halberstadt in Germany , Florian was enthusiastic about music from an early age; at 14 years old he began playing the guitar.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm for music developed slowly in the direction of electronic dance music. In 2000 Florian attended some of his first \"Techno\"-Parties. The positive energy of the partygoers, the extravagant music and with it that rhythmical, driving beat, captured Florian's imagination.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter in 2002, Florian bought himself his first records along with the necessary gear, and with all his focus, started to throw down some tracks under the name \"P.C.I\".\r\nIn 2004 he discovered his passion for the software program Propellerhead Reason and began to produce Hip Hop and Electro / House.\r\n\r\nMore projects followed, such as in 2008: \"The Masked Nerdz\" in which he produced Electro Rave along with three other lads from Bielefeld. And then in 2012: \"Noize4All\" which he did with a friend from Erfurt.\r\n\r\nThen on the 11th November 2012, his current project was born under the name: Florian Paetzold! He is personally very proud of this project and is putting his full love of music into it.\r\n\r\nHis remix of \"Sunday Girl - Where Is My Mind\" was voted among the Top 100 Edits in the trndmusik.de charts for 2012!\r\n\r\n2013 will be yet another year full of new music.

Talking about the young and talented KlangKuenstler, you have to add another organ of perception: the heart. Music without emotion is useless. Emotional music reminds us that we shouldn’t think about yesterday or tomorrow, what counts is solely to enjoy here and now. Music should preserve our feelings, tickle out our endorphins and – in the best case – be a joyful escapism from the hectic everyday life. Welcome to the world of KlangKuenstler!\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nIn 2012, the 23-year-old Michael Korb choose the way from bavarian solitude to the center of hustle and bustle when he moved to germany’s capital – Berlin calling! Only a few years before, he had his first contact with electronic music. His enthusiasm was activated by his first club experience in Munich, which came along like a revelation: loud music, people are dancing, the colorful lights and smiling faces everywhere. At the age of 18 years, his passion begins to professionalize. The KlangKuenstler start digging records and was looking for new and inspiring music. No, not the common chart material thrilled him; he was seeking for fresh tunes and a home for his first productions. In 2011, he founded the label “Zuckerton Records” to release his music and give other artists with a unique style a platform for their music.\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nHis music is warm, mellow, and soft; it embodies a cheerfulness that you can describe like the perfect match between romance and hedonism. On his first productions indicates that KlangKuenstler is a musing dreamer: His track “Freudenstraene” was a huge milestone in his young career and with two million plays on Youtube quite a success. \u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nIt is said that nature gives a man his abilities, and the happiness brings them into effect. Talking about the KlangKuenstler, we have to add his almost impressive talent. With releases on labels such as “Great Stuff” or “Stil Vor Talent”, he has created an inimitable style and his own voice, which honors his alter ego: his deep and tech house is not only in love with melodies, but passionately produced. Think of a kaleidoscope that captures a variety of different colors. Whether it's jazz, soul, funk or his great passion for pathetic sensual strings – out of several mosaics he creates a total work of art that simply sprays a positive vibe.\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nAlthough he appears as a DJ from time to time, KlangKuenstler is first and foremost a live act, which wants to introduce his own productions in the club. Here he cannot only engage spontaneously to the particular mood of the crowd, but also arrange his own tracks in an always new and appealing way. On the Berlin based label Stil vor Talent he released his single \"Barfuss auf Wolken\", which is not only a highlight of his set, but already reached more than 400.000 plays on Soundcloud. The track will also be featured on Oliver Koletzki’s „Schneeweiß Compilation II“. \u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nIt does not need a glimpse in the crystal ball to predict a promising future for KlangKuenstler. In 2014, his debut album „Das Bin Ich“ will be released. The long player embodies his own compass – it indicates his origins, his current status as an emerging live act and suggests new directions he will follow. Whether epic chords, his fetish for grasping bass lines or these joyful melodies – „Das Bin Ich“ is a multi-faceted, atmospheric and first and last a very emotional record. It is such a heavenly sensation to follow his heart.
