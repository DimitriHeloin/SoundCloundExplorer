Oli Cash, has gained a reputation for hi-tech, dancefloor-destroying music that makes people throw their hands in the air and go crazy. Think high-energy, aggressive funk, big basslines, crazy edits, intricate production and you’ll know the sound. \r\n\r\nSince his first release, back in 2005, things have gone ever upward. Winning “Best Single” at the Breakspoll Awards in 2007 was a huge boost early on and later that year the huge FTL anthem “Play It Loud”, which saw a move from breakbeat into big, dirty electro-house grooves, received a massive response and remains a firm crowd-pleaser to this day. Subsequent chart-smashers including “Bring Back Boogie” and “Megaloud”, and remixes for the likes of Lily Allen and The Crystal Method confirmed Far Too Loud's place among the big guns of electro-house. \r\n\r\n2012 saw Far Too Loud grow even more, with numerous Beatport top ten chart positions, remixes for artists such as Excision and Cyberpunkers and the release of his multi-genre Firestorm EP, which shook up the whole bass music scene.  2013 looks to be even bigger, as the “Faster Than Light” EP drops on June 3rd, featuring four brand new tracks bursting with his explosive trademark production and energy.\r\n\r\nHaving toured the world over, Oli is well experienced in delivering unique sets packed with high energy, whether it’s 200 people in a sweaty underground club or 20,000 at an outdoor festival, you can be sure it’s going to go off!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBookings\r\nAustralia\r\nstuart.balfour@ministryofsound.com.au\r\nBrazil/Mexico\r\nleandro@lve.art.br\r\nNorth America\r\nkevin@circletalentagency.com\r\nRest of World\r\ncontact@electrobooking.com\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nnick@nsdmt.com","city":"Brighton","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":"fartooloud","website":"http://fartooloud.com","website_title":"","online":false,"track_count":48,"playlist_count":6,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":419,"followers_count":73400,"followings_count":585,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":384978,"kind":"user","permalink":"fareoh","username":"Fareoh","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/384978","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/fareoh","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000058835714-gnivpa-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"United States","full_name":"","description":"","city":"New York","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://fareoh.com","website_title":"F A R E O H","online":false,"track_count":13,"playlist_count":0,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":1,"followers_count":83915,"followings_count":0,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":802294,"kind":"user","permalink":"t-e-e-d","username":"T-E-E-D","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/802294","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/t-e-e-d","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000017235875-oq7w12-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"Britain (UK)","full_name":"Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs","description":"\u003Ca href=\"http://gigs.gigatools.com/u/TEED\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETotally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs's Upcoming Gigs\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003C/a\u003ESaturday 21 December, 2013 \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.valhallafestival.nl/2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E[DJ] B2B with Eats Everything, Valhalla Festival, Amsterdam, Netherlands\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ETuesday 31 December, 2013 \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.tickettannoy.com/lwe/event/7e389a34-46aa-4838-8556-b23a08b3caec\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E[DJ], Building Six, London, United Kingdom\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ETuesday 31 December, 2013 \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://whpboxoffice2013.eventgenius.co.uk/events/The-Warehouse-29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E[DJ], The Warehouse Project, Manchester, United Kingdom\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ESaturday 11 January, 2014 \u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://gigs.gigatools.com/u/TEED\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E[DJ], Day Zero -

These artists have influenced and inspired him from his early stage of development.\u0026#13;\nFrom 2007 - 2009 Robin also hosted a local party series called \"Electroschnipsel\".\u0026#13;\nIn 2009 he wanted to put into effect his own ideas and started to engage himself with own productions.\u0026#13;\nThe first inspired tracks with minimalistic nature were created with FL Studio and an Edirol PCR-300 MIDI Keyboard.\u0026#13;\nOver the years his sound changed into direction of tech house and deep house, what can be heard in his current tracks, mostly produced with Ableton Live.\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\n[Biografie:Deutsch]\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nRobin Schulz wurde im Jahr 1987 in Osnabrück geboren.\u0026#13;\nFrüh schon wurde er von elektronischer Musik und all ihren Facetten geprägt und begann sich aktiv damit zu beschäftigen eigene Sets zu mischen.\u0026#13;\nEr fing mit den guten alten Technics MK2 und einem Pioneer DJM 600 an und wechselte später zur Digitalen Variante mit dem Traktor Kontrol S4 und einem Akai APC40.\u0026#13;\nAuf die Teller kamen damals Tracks von Richie Hawtin, Sven Väth, M.A.N.D.Y, Lexy \u0026amp; K.

at 14 years old he began playing the guitar.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm for music developed slowly in the direction of electronic dance music. In 2000 Florian attended some of his first \"Techno\"-Parties. The positive energy of the partygoers, the extravagant music and with it that rhythmical, driving beat, captured Florian's imagination.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter in 2002, Florian bought himself his first records along with the necessary gear, and with all his focus, started to throw down some tracks under the name \"P.C.I\".\r\nIn 2004 he discovered his passion for the software program Propellerhead Reason and began to produce Hip Hop and Electro / House.\r\n\r\nMore projects followed, such as in 2008: \"The Masked Nerdz\" in which he produced Electro Rave along with three other lads from Bielefeld. And then in 2012: \"Noize4All\" which he did with a friend from Erfurt.\r\n\r\nThen on the 11th November 2012, his current project was born under the name: Florian Paetzold! He is personally very proud of this project and is putting his full love of music into it.\r\n\r\nHis remix of \"Sunday Girl - Where Is My Mind\" was voted among the Top 100 Edits in the trndmusik.de charts for 2012!\r\n\r\n2013 will be yet another year full of new music. There are releases planned, as wells as edits and remixes!","city":"Osterwieck","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":null,"website_title":null,"online":false,"track_count":32,"playlist_count":4,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":539,"followers_count":12028,"followings_count":151,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":494163,"kind":"user","permalink":"disclosuremusic","username":"Disclosure","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/494163","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/disclosuremusic","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000039477229-dcene8-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":null,"full_name":"","description":"Our debut album 'Settle' is OUT NOW on iTunes: http://po.st/SettleDLXSC\r\n\r\nFull Date Listings - http://disclosureofficial.com/live/\r\n\r\nLive/DJ Bookings - tom@codaagency.com \u0026 lee@amonly.com (North America)\r\n\r\nManagement : sam@methodmusic.co.uk / jack@methodmusic.co.uk\r\n\r\n(We tend not to check our inbox on here...tweet us)","city":"","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://disclosureofficial.com","website_title":"Official Website","online":false,"track_count":14,"playlist_count":3,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":116,"followers_count":457182,"followings_count":590,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":18524665,"kind":"user","permalink":"fennec-wolf","username":"Fennec \u0026 Wolf","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/18524665","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/fennec-wolf","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000059353063-okhmkb-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"Germany","full_name":"","description":"Booking:\r\nrequest@kallias-booking.de\r\n\r\nContact-Remix resquests: fennecandwolf@gmail.com","city":"Cologne","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://fennecandwolf.com/","website_title":"Fennec\u0026Wolf","online":false,"track_count":23,"playlist_count":1,"plan":"Pro Plus","public_favorites_count":60,"followers_count":9688,"followings_count":185,"subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited","name":"Pro Unlimited"}}]},{"id":20713856,"kind":"user","permalink":"dodssoapandsaoul","username":"Dods Soap \u0026 Saoul","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/20713856","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/dodssoapandsaoul","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000030116707-4qd45t-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"France","full_name":"Dods Drvll","description":null,"city":"Bordeaux","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":null,"website_title":null,"online":false,"track_count":0,"playlist_count":0,"plan":"Free","public_favorites_count":12,"followers_count":4,"followings_count":36,"subscriptions":[]},{"id":426771,"kind":"user","permalink":"klangkuenstler","username":"klangkuenstler","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/426771","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/klangkuenstler","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000057151166-qvrr32-large.jpg?d53bf9f","country":"Germany","full_name":"","description":"\u003Cb\u003ELive Act \u0026amp;

Talking about the young and talented KlangKuenstler, you have to add another organ of perception: the heart. Music without emotion is useless. Emotional music reminds us that we shouldn’t think about yesterday or tomorrow, what counts is solely to enjoy here and now. Music should preserve our feelings, tickle out our endorphins and – in the best case – be a joyful escapism from the hectic everyday life. Welcome to the world of KlangKuenstler!\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nIn 2012, the 23-year-old Michael Korb choose the way from bavarian solitude to the center of hustle and bustle when he moved to germany’s capital – Berlin calling! Only a few years before, he had his first contact with electronic music. His enthusiasm was activated by his first club experience in Munich, which came along like a revelation: loud music, people are dancing, the colorful lights and smiling faces everywhere. At the age of 18 years, his passion begins to professionalize. The KlangKuenstler start digging records and was looking for new and inspiring music. No, not the common chart material thrilled him; he was seeking for fresh tunes and a home for his first productions. In 2011, he founded the label “Zuckerton Records” to release his music and give other artists with a unique style a platform for their music.\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nHis music is warm, mellow, and soft; it embodies a cheerfulness that you can describe like the perfect match between romance and hedonism. On his first productions indicates that KlangKuenstler is a musing dreamer: His track “Freudenstraene” was a huge milestone in his young career and with two million plays on Youtube quite a success. \u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nIt is said that nature gives a man his abilities, and the happiness brings them into effect. Talking about the KlangKuenstler, we have to add his almost impressive talent. With releases on labels such as “Great Stuff” or “Stil Vor Talent”, he has created an inimitable style and his own voice, which honors his alter ego: his deep and tech house is not only in love with melodies, but passionately produced. Think of a kaleidoscope that captures a variety of different colors. Whether it's jazz, soul, funk or his great passion for pathetic sensual strings – out of several mosaics he creates a total work of art that simply sprays a positive vibe.\u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nAlthough he appears as a DJ from time to time, KlangKuenstler is first and foremost a live act, which wants to introduce his own productions in the club. Here he cannot only engage spontaneously to the particular mood of the crowd, but also arrange his own tracks in an always new and appealing way. On the Berlin based label Stil vor Talent he released his single \"Barfuss auf Wolken\", which is not only a highlight of his set, but already reached more than 400.000 plays on Soundcloud. The track will also be featured on Oliver Koletzki’s „Schneeweiß Compilation II“. \u0026#13;\n\u0026#13;\nIt does not need a glimpse in the crystal ball to predict a promising future for KlangKuenstler. In 2014, his debut album „Das Bin Ich“ will be released. The long player embodies his own compass – it indicates his origins, his current status as an emerging live act and suggests new directions he will follow. Whether epic chords, his fetish for grasping bass lines or these joyful melodies – „Das Bin Ich“ is a multi-faceted, atmospheric and first and last a very emotional record. It is such a heavenly sensation to follow his heart.
